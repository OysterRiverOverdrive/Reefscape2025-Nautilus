    Ex.

    --Then for formatting event-based commands toegther--

    function andThen() is a sequential command group
        -commands one after another
    function alongWith() is a parallel command group
        -commands with each other
    function deadlineWith() runs commands alongside the previous group until one of the commands stop.
        -the first command to stop will stop the entire group

    first:
    andThen(alongWith(Command... commands that are going to run))
    .andThen(alongWith())
    ...
        .deadlineWith()
    and that's the first cycle :)


    Ex.
    andThen(alongWith(MoveToReef, New AutoElevatorCmd(elevator, ElevatorToLv1)))
    .andThen(New AutoElevatorCmd(elevator, ReleaseCoral))

    **this example code just drives straight to the reef from the middle starting point and unloads a coral onto the reef.
